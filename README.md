Message encryptor and decryptor based on an Ethereum implementation of ECIES with a GUI.

On starting, a keypair is generated and saved in keys.dat file. It should be possible to replace keys with your Ethereum wallet's keys, but I have not tested that.

* To encrypt a message, insert recipient's public key to the `recipient` field, enter `input`, click `encrypt`, then send them the encrypted message.
* To decrypt a message, just insert the encrypted message into the `input` field and click `decrypt`. You need to be the intended recipient based on your address.
